#  <h1> Task 1: software configuration. </h1>
 <h2> Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge? </h2>

<h3> Why did you decide to participate in the project? </h3>
First of all, I want to thank you for giving me a chance to try myself out in this field. It is a great pleasure! I was interested in QA for a quite a long time, because I think it is interesting and fast-changing field of studies. The second thing is a certificate because people need a proof of excellence. And the last, but not least is a chance to become an intern after the completion of the challenge.
<h3> What was driving you? </h3>
It was a desire to learn something new and to challenge myself.
<h3> What is your goal? </h3>
I want to finish the challenge having enough knowledge in QA to walk this path alone.
<h3> What are your expectations for the project? </h3>
I expect to find many interesting people, to have some kind of mentors and for project to push me that good so I can become really good in QA.
